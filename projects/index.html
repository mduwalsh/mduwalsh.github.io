		  <span>Collective Action Problem With Propaganda</span> :  Jan, 2016 - on going
		</div> 
		<div class="project-desc">
		  <p>
		  Propaganda model by Dr. Sergey Gavrilets is two level hierarchial model with leader and commoners in a group. 
		  The model tries to solve collective action problem with commoners making production efforts, 
		  leaders making norm promoting (propaganda) effort, 
		  collecting taxes from commoners and punishing commoners not making efforts.
		  I am helping Dr. Gavrilets with simulation developing program in C++ and helping with analysis and development of the model.
		  Graphs were plotted using gnuplot.

		  Multi-level collective action problem model by Dr. Sergey Gavrilets has three level hierarchy with chief in a polity,

		  The model tries to solve collective action problem with commoners making production efforts, leaders making coordination effort, 
		  collecting taxes from commoners and punishing commoners not making efforts, and chief making coordination effort, collecting taxes from leaders, 
		  distributing rewards to polity and punishing least efficient leaders.

		  <span>Collective Action Problem With Punishment</span> :  Jun, 2015 - Feb, 2016
		</div>
		<div class="project-desc">
		  <p>
		  Collective action problem with punishment model by Dr. Sergey Gavrilets tries to solve problem with production efforts and payoffs 
		  with use of punishment through modeling and simulation. Simulation was event driven and time of event were chosen using 
		  Gillespie's algorithm. Model included collective action with punishment where every individual tries to punish others 
		  and force others to contribute. Punishment is costly, so foresight strategy was introduced to motivate individuals to punish 
		  others by predicting and expecting benefit in return.		 
		  I developed simulation program in C, tested and debugged the program, helped with analysis and development of the model.
		  Graphs were plotted using gnuplot.

		<div class="project-desc">
		  <p>
		  Collective action problem model by Dr. Sergey Gavrilets tries to solve problem with production efforts and payoffs in a group 
		  with hierarchial system through modeling and simulation. Simulation was agent based, and model included male and female 
		  group members, migration, group production, group conflicts, competition (Us Vs Them game) and extinction, 
		  and competition against nature (Us Vs Nature game).
		  I developed simulation program in C, tested and debugged the program, wrote shell script to run multiple simulations in Linux 
		  cluster with Torque resource manager. Results were summarized for analysis by plotting graphs using gnuplot script embedded in C.

		    Maintained and modified of the application features, developed of new modules, 
		    generated reports, optimized queries for report generation. 
		    Developed and maintained unit tests in Groovy/ Spock unit testing frameworks. 
		    Also developed a generic client independent MYSQL database scripts (automation ready)
